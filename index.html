    <p><b>Hello my name is Icram Doku. I am the creator and author of this website. 
	I found myself struggling with money and did some research. I found this 50/30/20 
	Rule and started following it. It worked greatly for me so I thought I should share 
	it.</b></p><br>

	<p>As a high school student (with a job) and now a college student I still struggle to 
	save enough money. I hate asking my parents for money at the end of the month. So, 
	with some research I found this simple rule and found it very easy to follow!</p>
	
	<p>Of course, this rule applies when you are a beginner (like me) to saving. If you
	are saving for a big purchase like a new car or a house, this will only help you to
	get in the habit of saving. You will gradually have to increase the percent of your
	saving!</p>
	
	<p>With the disclaimers out of the way, have fun! Play around with it. Budget better
	for future and prospect income.</p>
