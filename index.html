    <p><b>Hello my name is Icram Doku. I am the creator and author of this website.
	I found myself struggling with money and did some reseach. I found this 60/30/10
	Rule and started following it. It worked greatly for me so I though I should share
	it.</b></p><br>

	<p>As a high school student and college student (with a job) I still struggle to 
	save enough money. I hate asking my parents for money at the end of the month. So, 
	with some reseach I found this simple rule and found it very easy to follow!</p>
	
	<p>Of course, this rule applies when you are a beginner (like me) to saving. If you 
	are saving for a big purcase like a new car or a house, this will only help you to 
	get in the habit of saving. You will gradualy have to increase the percent of your 
	saving!</p>
	
	<p>With the disclimers out of the way, have fun! play around with it. Budget for 
	future and prospect income.</p>
